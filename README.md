# Melting Pot

*Melting pot* is a compound which is compositional and non-compositional at the same time depending on the context. In this project, we explore use of sense representations to improve detection of compositional nominal compounds, like this one.

## Results

Using sense/adagram vs the original model as presented in http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1187:

- some improvement based on sensegram currently observed 

## Datasets
