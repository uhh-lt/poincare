Oh, sit ups are called crunches, too. That's a difficult physical exercise for some people. Yeah, crunching is strenuous, but you can't really crunch a number.

Crunching is so widely used in this manner that that the idiom is actually listed as a definition... Otherwise, I would have rated it as a 1 (as ""crunching"" would still have some use in terms of ""getting through"" or ""destroying"" numbers, or w/e)
